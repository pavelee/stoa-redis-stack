Stoa is a small forum app. The inspiration is a need of minimalistic internal forum for organizations. Designed to look like a typical social media app.

The main purpose of the project is to test redis as main database. I am using redisJSON to store documents and RediSearch to perform searches.

Stack:

* Typescript
* Next.js
* tailwindcss
* Redis stack

## How it works

### How the data is stored:
